# GitOps
GitOps developement with Gitpython packages

### Intro
The main purpose of this repo is to do git operations via python code, and upload it to gitea. After trying pygithub, giteapy and gitpython, I think gitpython is the most suitable one.

### Why redefine operations?

Because in git add, I only want to upload untracked files, modified files but not deleted files.
